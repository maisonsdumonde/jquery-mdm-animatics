jquery-mdm-animatics (naming pending)
------------------------------------

(Warning: The plugin is only a draft, its code and functionalities will change, so use it at your own risk).

This is a plugin for creating animatics with jQuery.

It aims for scalability and extensibility and thus is mainly event based, letting you plug-in any handlers you want (thumbnails, counters, other manipluators etc.).

It's image list is managed manually, and all images needs to be passed as an array, to decouple from any html structure and improve portability.
